# gt done

Signal that a polecat's work is complete and ready for the merge
queue. The canonical way a polecat ends a work cycle — submits the
branch to MQ, notifies the Witness, and transitions the polecat to
IDLE with sandbox preserved.

**Parent:** [gt](../binaries/gt.md) (root command)
**Group:** `GroupWork` ("Work Management") (`done.go:33`)
**Polecat-safe:** yes (`AnnotationPolecatSafe: "true"` on
`done.go:34`)
**Beads-exempt:** no
**Branch-check-exempt:** no
**`SilenceUsage: true`** (`done.go:59`) — operational errors don't
print the usage blurb, which "confuses agents" per the inline
comment.

## What it actually does

Source: `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/internal/cmd/done.go:31-89` for
the cobra surface; the full `runDone` implementation is 1896 lines
and encodes the entire polecat end-of-work dance.

**Critical role guard** at `done.go:91-100`: `gt done` is for
polecats only. If `BD_ACTOR` is set and `!isPolecatActor(actor)`, the
command refuses with a message explaining the asymmetry — polecats
end sessions with `gt done`, other roles persist across tasks and
don't use it. See the related guard in [prime](prime.md) that warns
**agents not to run `gt done` at all** unless they are a polecat.

### Invocation

```
gt done [--issue <id>] [--status <STATUS>] [--pre-verified] [--target <branch>] [--priority <N>] [--cleanup-status <state>] [--resume]
```

### Exit statuses (`done.go:73-77`)

```go
ExitCompleted = "COMPLETED"
ExitEscalated = "ESCALATED"
ExitDeferred  = "DEFERRED"
```

From the `Long` help (`done.go:45-49`):

- `COMPLETED` — work done, MR submitted (default).
- `ESCALATED` — hit a blocker, needs human intervention; skips MR.
- `DEFERRED` — work paused, issue still open; skips MR.

### Behavior outline

Based on the first ~200 lines of `runDone` (`done.go:91-200`) and
the top-level help:

1. **Record telemetry on exit** via
   `telemetry.RecordDone(context.Background(), status, retErr)` in a
   defer (`done.go:92`).
2. **Validate role** — block non-polecats as described above.
3. **Validate exit status** — must be one of the three constants
   (`done.go:102-106`).
4. **Find workspace with fallback** — `workspace.FindFromCwdWithFallback`
   (`done.go:115-118`). The fallback exists because the Witness may
   have deleted the polecat's worktree before `gt done` finishes
   (referenced bead `hq-3xaxy`). If cwd is unavailable, fall back to
   `GT_POLECAT_PATH`.
5. **Determine current rig** — walk the rel-path from town root to
   cwd for the first component, then override with `GT_RIG` env var
   if set (`done.go:132-151`). The env var is more reliable than
   cwd-derived rig name because Claude Code's Bash tool may have
   reset cwd to `mayor/rig`.
6. **Normalize cwd to polecat worktree** — if cwd is not inside
   `polecats/`, reconstruct the expected polecat clone path using
   `GT_POLECAT` or `GT_CREW` env vars (`done.go:161-179`). Then walk
   up from cwd to the git repo root stopping if we leave the
   polecats area (`done.go:185-198`).
7. **Git init + further work** — initializes
   `internal/git`, `internal/polecat`, session, mail, events,
   telemetry, templates, townlog, rig, beads, config. The full flow
   (branch detection, MR submission, worktree sync to main, Witness
   notification, IDLE transition) spans the remaining 1700 lines.

The surface-level help text (`done.go:36-57`) summarizes the
downstream steps as:

1. Submits the current branch to the merge queue.
2. Auto-detects issue ID from branch name.
3. Notifies the Witness with the exit outcome.
4. Syncs worktree to main and transitions polecat to IDLE (sandbox
   preserved, session stays alive for reuse).

### Subcommands

None. `grep doneCmd.AddCommand ... done.go` returns no hits.

### Flags

Defined in `init()` at `done.go:79-89`:

| flag | short | type | default | description |
|------|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--issue` | — | string | `""` | Source issue ID (default: parse from branch name) |
| `--priority` | `-p` | int | `-1` | Override priority (0-4, default: inherit from issue) |
| `--status` | — | string | `COMPLETED` | Exit status: COMPLETED, ESCALATED, or DEFERRED |
| `--cleanup-status` | — | string | `""` | Git cleanup status: clean, uncommitted, unpushed, stash, unknown (ZFC: agent-observed) |
| `--resume` | — | bool | `false` | Resume from last checkpoint (auto-detected, for Witness recovery) |
| `--pre-verified` | — | bool | `false` | Mark MR as pre-verified (polecat ran gates after rebasing onto target) |
| `--target` | — | string | `""` | Explicit MR target branch (overrides formula_vars and auto-detection) |

### Related commands

- [handoff](handoff.md) — the sister command. Polecats running
  `gt handoff` are silently redirected to `gt done --status
  DEFERRED` (`handoff.go:152-161`). Non-polecats use `gt handoff`
  directly.
- [hook](hook.md) — refuses polecat access entirely
  (`hook.go:224-231`) — polecats cannot hook work because their
  session lifecycle is driven by `gt done`.
- [mq](mq.md) — the merge queue that `gt done` submits into (via
  the underlying refinery / `bd mq` path).
- [convoy](convoy.md) — convoys that tracked the closed issue get
  checked via [close](close.md)'s `checkConvoyCompletion`.
- [../binaries/gt.md](../binaries/gt.md) — root.

## Docs claim

[docs/CLEANUP.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown/blob/main/docs/CLEANUP.md) claims: "Polecat self-cleaning: pushes branch, submits MR (by default), self-nukes worktree, kills own session. MR skipped for `--status ESCALATED\|DEFERRED` or `no_merge` paths"

## Drift

Code post-gt-4ac/gt-hdf8 no longer self-nukes; transitions to IDLE with sandbox preserved. Nuke is explicit via `gt polecat nuke`.

## Notes / open questions

- **1896-line command.** The bulk of the logic is a linear script
  handling edge cases: deleted worktrees, cwd resets by Claude Code's
  Bash tool, polecat-not-polecat role drift, and Witness-mediated
  cleanup. Each edge-case patch has a bead reference in comments
  (e.g. `hq-3xaxy`, `gt-hdf8`). Worth a dedicated concept page on
  "polecat lifecycle" rather than forcing it into a command page.
- **Telemetry hook** uses `strings.ToUpper(doneStatus)` for the
  status label (`done.go:92`). So `--status completed` works just
  as well as `COMPLETED`.
- **Persistent polecat model** — comment at `done.go:108-110`
  references bead `gt-hdf8`: "sessions stay alive after gt done. No
  deferred session kill — the polecat transitions to IDLE with
  sandbox preserved." The sandbox-preservation design is worth a
  concept page.
- **`BD_ACTOR` vs `GT_ROLE`** — the role guard checks `BD_ACTOR` not
  `GT_ROLE`. Both are polecat identity indicators but come from
  different layers; confirm whether they're kept in sync.
