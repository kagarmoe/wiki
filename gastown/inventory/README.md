# gastown inventory

Neutral, flat enumeration of everything in `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/`.
No interpretation, no classification, no drift claims — just a
comprehensive list of what's in the repo with factual metadata (file
sizes, line counts, package file counts). Drives subsequent batches of
per-entity wiki pages.

## Pages

- [repo-root.md](repo-root.md) — every file and directory at the
  top level of the gastown repo, with size and immediate-child count.
- [docs-tree.md](docs-tree.md) — every file under `docs/` with line
  count and path.
- [go-packages.md](go-packages.md) — every Go package under `cmd/`,
  `internal/`, and `plugins/` with Go file and test file counts.

## What is NOT here

- **Scripts in `scripts/`.** Pending a separate enumeration pass.
- **Templates in `templates/` and `gt-model-eval/`.** Pending.
- **The contents of `npm-package/`.** Pending.
- **Hidden config directories** (`.beads/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`,
  `.githooks/`, `.opencode/`, `.runtime/`) except as listed at the
  repo root level. Their contents are not enumerated here.
- **Nested subcommand tree.** The 111 top-level commands are listed
  in [../commands/README.md](../commands/README.md). The ~384 nested
  subcommands that make up the remaining 495 − 111 ≈ 384 total
  `cobra.Command` definitions are a separate enumeration pass.
- **Per-file prose content.** This inventory lists files and counts
  only. Reading each file and writing an entity page with "what it
  actually does" is the next batch after enumeration.

## Method

Counts captured in one session on 2026-04-11 via
`ls`, `find`, and `wc -l` from inside `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/`.
Reproducible commands are documented at the top of each inventory
page. The counts are a snapshot and will drift as upstream evolves.
