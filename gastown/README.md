# gastown

## Mission (current phase)

This topic **maps the gastown codebase in the wiki** so that every part
is represented at inventory level and every load-bearing part has a
full entity page that **accurately describes what the code actually
does**, read off the source and cited with `file:line` references. See
the plan at `.claude/plans/2026-04-11-gastown-map.md` for the design,
the 12-layer traversal, the load-bearing test, and the cross-linking
discipline.

**Deliverable this phase:** a wiki that answers "what does gastown's
`<component>` actually do?" with code-grounded pages. Nothing else.

**Explicitly out of scope this phase:**

- Drift analysis, gap analysis against upstream docs, audience
  classification, upstream documentation rewrites — all deferred to
  later phases.
- Reading `docs/` content beyond inventory rows — phase 3.
- Edits to anything outside `~/repos/wiki/`. `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/`
  is read-only reference.

## Working model

- Read from `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/` (source of truth, never
  modified).
- Produce wiki pages under this topic following the schema's entity
  template (frontmatter + "What it actually does" + `file:line`
  source refs + "Notes / open questions").
- Link every entity page to every adjacent entity per the cross-linking
  discipline in the plan — forward links, back-references, alias
  coverage, `grep`-verified before commit. This is what makes the wiki
  answer multi-hop questions later.
- Track follow-up investigation work in **beads** — `bd list -l gastown`
  for the live queue. Agent-task conventions in the "Task tracking"
  section of [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Coordinates

- **Source under investigation:** `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/`
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown
- **Go module path declared in `go.mod`:** `github.com/steveyegge/gastown`
  (the `gastownhall` repo self-identifies under the `steveyegge`
  namespace, so `go install` must use the `steveyegge` path)
- **Separate runtime workspace:** `~/gt/` — the Docker-containerized
  deployment of `gt`. Not part of the wiki; independent from this
  mapping effort.

## Scope of the map

gastown is a multi-agent orchestration system for AI coding runtimes,
managed by the `gt` CLI. The map will cover, in order (see plan for
the 12 layers):

- Build & packaging (Makefile, Dockerfiles, flake.nix, .goreleaser.yml, go.mod)
- Binaries & entry points (`cmd/gt`, `cmd/gt-proxy-server`, `cmd/gt-proxy-client`)
- The command layer (all ~107 top-level commands in `internal/cmd/`)
- Platform services (`cli`, `config`, `session`, `workspace`, `style`, `ui`, `telemetry`, `version`, `util`)
- Data layer (`beads`, `doltserver`, `mail`, `nudge`, `events`, etc.)
- Agent runtime — packages + first-class domain entities: roles
  (mayor, polecat, crew, dog, deacon, refinery, witness, wisp, reaper),
  concepts (convoy, rig, molecule, formula, directive, identity,
  polecat-lifecycle), services, workflows
- Diagnostics & health (`doctor`, `health`, `keepalive`, `deps`)
- Long-running processes (`daemon`, `tmux`, `runtime`)
- Supporting libraries
- Plugins (`plugins/*`)
- Auxiliary trees (`scripts/`, `templates/`, `gt-model-eval/`, `npm-package/`, `.github/`, `.githooks/`, `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.runtime/`)
- Documentation tree (`docs/`) — inventory only this phase

## Sub-index

### Binaries

- [gt](binaries/gt.md) — main CLI; entry point, ldflags, startup sequence, command groups, exempt-command maps

### Commands

- [gt command tree](commands/README.md) — inventory of all 111 top-level `rootCmd.AddCommand` registrations + 495 total `cobra.Command` definitions
- [version](commands/version.md) — `gt version` subcommand

### Files

- [Makefile](files/makefile.md) — canonical build recipe

### Inventory

- [inventory/README.md](inventory/README.md) — neutral A-level enumeration of repo contents
  - [repo-root](inventory/repo-root.md) — top-level files and directories at `/home/kimberly/repos/gastown/`
  - [docs-tree](inventory/docs-tree.md) — every file under `docs/` with line counts
  - [go-packages](inventory/go-packages.md) — every Go package under `cmd/`, `internal/`, `plugins/` with file counts
